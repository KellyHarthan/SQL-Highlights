--QUESTION 1:
--Find all players who hit their career highest number of home runs in 2016. Consider only players who have played 
--in the league for at least 10 years, and who hit at least one home run in 2016. 
--Report the players' first and last names and the number of home runs they hit in 2016.


SELECT CONCAT (namelast,' ',namefirst),
	   hr AS hr_in2016
FROM	(SELECT namefirst,
			    namelast,
			    hr,
			    yearid,
			    EXTRACT(year FROM finalgame::date) - EXTRACT(year FROM debut::date) + 1 AS career_seasons, --this will allow filtering based on carrer length
			    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY playerid ORDER BY hr DESC) AS player_hr_by_year_rank --this allows filtering for players' best hr year
		FROM people AS p INNER JOIN batting AS b USING(playerid)
		WHERE HR > 0) AS ranks --going ahead and filtering out rows where the player didn't have any home runs
WHERE player_hr_by_year_rank = 1
AND yearid = 2016
AND career_seasons >= 10;

--Alternative ANSWER

WITH max_hr AS(SELECT playerid, MAX(hr) AS max_hr
	FROM batting
	GROUP BY playerid)

SELECT CONCAT (namelast, ' ',namefirst), max_hr
FROM max_hr INNER JOIN people USING (playerid)

WHERE yearid = 2016
AND max_hr >0
AND hr = max_hr
AND (2016 - EXTRACT (YEAR FROM debut::date)) >=10
ORDER BY max_hr DESC


--QUESTION 2:
--Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. 
--How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?

WITH player_appearances AS (SELECT CONCAT(namefirst, ' ', namelast) AS name,
							height,
							g_all,

GROUP BY player_appearances.name, height, g_all, teams.name
ORDER BY height
LIMIT 1;

--Question 3:
-- Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 
--(where average attendance is defined as total attendance divided by number of games). Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. 
--Report the park name, team name, and average attendance. 
--Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.

-- TOP 5--

	INNER JOIN teams as t ON h.team=t.teamid
WHERE h.year = 2016
GROUP BY p.park_name,t.name
HAVING COUNT(games)>=10
ORDER BY avg_attendance DESC
LIMIT 5

--BOTTOM 5
