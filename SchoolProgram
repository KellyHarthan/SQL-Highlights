/*QUESTION 2: Do longer poems have more emotional intensity compared to shorter poems?  No, they are almost exactly identical. See part B 
a. Start by writing a query to return each emotion in the database with its average intensity and character count. */

/*b. Convert the query you wrote in part a into a CTE. Then find the 5 most intense poems that express anger and whether they 
are to be longer or shorter than the average angry poem.*/	--SHORTER!	
-- -  What is the most angry poem about? A dancing horse or the heat of summer. They are tied in intensity
-- -  Do you think these are all classified correctly? No, looking though the text some of these would fit better into other emotional catagories.
